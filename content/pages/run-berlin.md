I want to run while we're at the Gathering in Berlin, and I want *you* yo join me. If you think the paces are to fast, or the routes too long. Please feel free to join me for part of the loops.

## Here's the plan...
While we have some time on the middle of the day on Saturday, I always find it hard to run when it is possible to choose going to a bar instead. I therefor want to run in the morning, leaving the rest of the day for enjoyment.

>Early bird gets the worm.

### Friday: Morning Easy jog

* **👟 Distance**: 11 km
* **⚡️ Pace**: 5:30 pr/km
* **🕖️ When**: 7:00
* **🗺️ Where**: Hotel lobby

Running at 7:00, and running 5:30 pace should bring us back to the hotel at 8. This leaves one hour for shower, getting dressed and eating breakfast. Welcome speech starts at 9.

```
Protip:
- Eat well the day before, and have a banana before the run.
- Pack out running gear the day before.
```

## Saturday: Intervals in Volkspark Friedrichshain park

Saturday intervals is a tradition for me, and I can't let the Gathering ruin the streak. The best thing about intervals is that we can run together, even if we run different paces. I made a suggestion for a 500m loop.

* **👟 Distance**: You decide
* **⚡️ Pace**: You decide 
* **🕖️ When**: 7:00
* **🗺️ Where**: Hotel lobby

The plan is to run to Volkspark Friedrichshain park (1,2km from the hotel). This is the same start of the route as the loop on Friday.

* Intervals start time: 🕖️ 7:15
* Done with intervals: 🕖️ 7:50 or earlier!
* This leaves again one hour to shower, dress and eat breakfast.
