For the longest time, I have ran my self hosted services from my Asrock x300 deskmini computer. It is super small, power efficient, powerfull (AMD 5700G) and barely makes a noice.

But as the saying goes...

> It doesn't matter how much you get; you are left wanting more.


<!-- more -->


So here are my requirements for the NAS.

* Room for atleast 8 x 3.5" SATA HDDs.
* ECC memory. If I'm going to put my money in a NAS, I want to do it proper.
* 2x full size PCIe slots. Atleast PCI-e 3.0.
    * One slot for intel a380 for video transcoding. Should handle all video formats (inclunding AV1!), with low heat and power.
    * Another slot for 4xm.2 drives.
    * PCIe bifurcation support.
* IOMMU for PCI passtrough.
* Power efficient and quite.
* Not very big.
* Relative performant. I want to run a couple of VMs, and services without breaking a sweat.
* 2.5 gbs networking, or extra PCIe to expand to it.


For the record, here is the use cases for the NAS.

* Running proxmox.
* Services:
    * Immich
    * Wireguard
    * Home assistant
    * Prometheus-grafana stack
    * Nextcloud
    * Jellyfin
    * Caddy
    * Sonarr and Radarr for video management
    * Audiobookshelf
    * Pasjonsfrukt for converting Podme podcasts to rss

## Choosing components

I was looking at a lot of hardware. Everything between old enterprise gear to extremely low end consumer offerings. Like the fantastic [Brian Moses - DIY NAS: 2023 Edition](https://blog.briancmoses.com/2023/03/diy-nas-2023-edition.html). For the parts I ended up ordering, I got inspiration from [2022 edition](https://blog.briancmoses.com/2021/11/diy-nas-2022-edition.html) project. It got almost everything that I want in a NAS. The motherboard he used has gotten a lot more expansive in last year, so at last I ruled it out. I also wanted something a bit more CPU power.

For refereance. Here's a chart of the AMD 5750GE, 5600GE, Xeon D-2123I (used in the 2022 edition), and Intel Celeron N5105 (used in the 2023 edition). Score is from  passmark on cpubenchmark.net

### Motherboard

I landed on a x470 based motherboard from ASrock rack. Big selling points is:
* mATX
* Supports ECC ram
* 8 SATA ports.
* IPMI
* 2 PCIe 3.0 slots with x8. 1 PCIe x4.
* AM 4 compatible
* Not too expensive $380(included tax) on Ebay.

### CPU

The motherboard supports a lot of CPUs, but I ended up looking at the latest supported ones, with PRO for ECC memory. Prices are from sellers on Ebay in NOK (Norwegian kroners).

| Type        | Name    | cores | watt | freq    | Price*|
|-------------|---------|-------|------|---------|-------|
| 5 PRO       | 5650G   | 6     | 65   | 3,9-4,4 | 1700  |
| 5 PRO       | 5650GE  | 6     | 35   | 3,4-4.4 | 1700  |
| 7 PRO       | 5750G   | 8     | 65   | 3,8-4,6 | 4000  |
| 7 PRO       | 5750GE  | 8     | 35   | 3,2-4,6 | 3000  |
| 3 PRO       | 5350G   | 4     | 65   | 4-4,2   | 1200  |
| 3 PRO       | 5350GE  | 4     | 35   | 3,6-4,2 | 1200  |
| 3 PRO       | 5300G   | 4     | 65   | 4-4-2,2 | 1100  |

`* Prices are without VAT.`

I really wanted the 5750GE, but It was a tad bit too expensive, so I ended up settling for the 5650GE. I am not sure how big the performance gap is between the GE and G models, and I could not find any good reviews about it. Basically G stands for graphics and E stands for efficiency. The GE CPUs have a bit lower clock speed, but looks to be more power efficient.

### Case

After spending a lot of time looking at more exotic options, I ended up with the boring, cheap and well regarded Fractal Node 804.

### Memory
I want ECC memory, and I want 32GB per slot, to be able to max it out if I need to. I went with:
`Kingston Server Premier - DDR4 - module - 32 GB - DIMM 288-pin - 3200 MHz / PC4-25600 - unbuffered`. It is not on the Asrock Rack list of qualified ram, but then again, almost nothing are. It is way cheaper then the only option for ECC 32GB on the list. (`M391A4G43MB1-CTDQ`). According to [this](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/amd-ryzen-with-ecc-and-6x-m-2-nvme-build.104574/page-3) thread on truenas forum, the modules should work with ECC:


### Disks
I do not have any HDDs at the moment. I want to buy 3x20TB disks an put them in RAIDZ1. That way I get 40TB of usable space. If I want to buy more, I can buy 3 more in a couple years.

## Quirks along the way

### PCIe bifucation
I found some forum posts claiming that bifucation was not supported when using APUs. I'm not sure about this, and have already ordered the APU from Ebay, I guess we will see if this is correct when it arrives.

### Resizable BAR, AKA Smart Access Memory AKA SAM
* This dude mention it in his [video](https://youtu.be/o9ML-vP3oFA?t=190), but I doubt that he has tested it.
* It gets mentioned in [this](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/137945-issues-with-an-rx-6600-killing-unraid-entirely/) thread on unraid forum. " AsRock Rack X470D4U (note, BIOS is fully updated, ReBAR is disabled, and SR-IOV is also disabled.)".

I'm not sure, but I think maybe that all motherboards that support AMD 5000 series also support SAM?

### IOMMU
From [this](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/asrock-rack-has-created-the-first-am4-socket-server-boards-x470d4u-x470d4u2-2t/139490/348) thread on the level1techs forum it should be supported:
Under: Advanced/AMD CBS/NBIO Common Options/ IOMMU (Auto is Default)
